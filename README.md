this site is an attempt to recreate the site for a hotel located in Uzbekistan - City Palace.
The City Palace Hotel is located in the very center of Tashkent, which is convenient for guests who are interested in the city itself
and its sights. The hotel is also convenient for meetings and business in Tashkent, due to its proximity to administrative centers. 
The interior of the hotel perfectly combines modern European style with original details of oriental design. 
City Palace â€” the perfect vacation in Tashkent for you!

For this site, the information was taken from the personal website of the City Palace, 
and in some places alternative information was added to introduce certain circumstances. 

The site consists of five web pages. The layout was made thanks to html5 and css3. No third-party libraries were involved. 
Adaptive layout was made so that the site could be opened both from mobile devices and a computer.
